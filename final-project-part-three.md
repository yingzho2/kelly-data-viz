# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
After interviewing my audiences, I gained a more well-rounded understanding of people's perspectives on traditional media and their experiences interacting with it. Surprisingly, instead of seeing purely traditional channels (TV, print, broadcast, etc.) as standalone tools, many described a funneling effect—using broad traditional media to reach the maximum audience, then guiding truly interested individuals to digital channels where more direct actions and conversions can occur.

Based on this, I’m adjusting my conclusion: marketers should consider adopting a hybrid marketing strategy that leverages both traditional and digital channels to maximize audience reach while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

## The audience

For my final data story, I identified the target audience as marketing professionals, advertising students, and business decision-makers — individuals directly impacted by shifting media trends or preparing to enter industries where strategic media planning is critical. I also included one marketing professor in my interviews, believing that an academic expert might offer a different and deeper perspective on the changes — not only from a business standpoint but also grounded in research and theory. I narrowed this focus based on my initial audience framework questions (who is affected, who could benefit, who could profit) and confirmed it through insights gathered during my interviews. Many respondents emphasized feeling overwhelmed by digital saturation but still saw value in traditional media for reach and trust-building. Based on this feedback, I adjusted my final project to highlight not just the resurgence of traditional media, but also the strategic blending of traditional and digital channels. I incorporated recent, relatable campaign examples and emphasized storytelling moments to better resonate with an audience looking for practical, actionable insights rather than a purely academic discussion.

## Final design decisions

Throughout this project, one of the most intentional design decisions I made was to visually highlight the contrast between traditional and digital media, not just through content, but through color, typography, and layout. The split-screen design with bold blue and orange backgrounds symbolized this tension and eventual harmony. I also learned how important pacing is in visual storytelling — using a mix of graphs, case studies, and quotes helped guide the reader through a shift in perspective. One key takeaway for me was the power of subtle visuals (like growth rate flattening in a chart) to tell a deeper story. Working with both qualitative interviews and quantitative data pushed me to think more critically about audience impact and balance emotional resonance with analytical insight.

# Final thoughts

Constructing this story was a fun and rewarding experience. I learned how powerful the right graph can be in emphasizing a point — letting the data drive the narrative rather than forcing a story onto the numbers. I also realized that a story can (and should) evolve as new facts and interview insights emerge; it’s important to stay flexible and embrace "plot twists" rather than sticking rigidly to the original plan. If I had more time, I would have liked to explore even more case studies across industries to further strengthen the connection between data trends and real-world examples. Overall, this project helped me better appreciate how storytelling, data visualization, and user feedback all work together to create a more dynamic and impactful final product.
