# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

To identify my target audience, I asked myself three guiding questions:

1. Who is directly affected by the shift in marketing trends?
2. Who isn't aware of the shift, but could benefit from understanding it?
3. Who stands to profit by adapting early to this change?

Based on that, I’ve identified three key audience groups for my story:

1. Marketing professionals – Brand managers, media planners, and CMOs who are actively shaping campaign strategy and media investments.
2. Advertising students & educators – Individuals studying marketing and communications who need to understand both traditional and digital media landscapes for academic and career success.
3. Business decision-makers – Especially those in industries like CPG, retail, or entertainment, where advertising spend is a key lever for growth and customer engagement.

|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| “When was the last time you were genuinely influenced by a TV or print ad?” | I don't remember honestly... The last TV ads I saw would prolly be Superbowl ads?|I still watch TV so I see those ads, but I don't think I am consiously getting affected by them. Or at least I don't think so.| Maybe a while ago, I scanned a QR code about a product? | Last election new administration |
| “In your experience, are traditional marketing channels still part of your media mix? If so, when and why?”|   not applicable    |     Yes, but we are spendig a lot more on social media/digital platforms        |      Digital is definitely dominating the media mix.      |     Many companies are over-investing in digital marketing, leading to a renewed interest in the concept of "phygital"—blending physical and digital experiences. There's growing potential in utilizing traditional marketing more effectively, especially through linear content and offline channels that complement digital efforts.     |
| “Do you personally find ads on TV/radio more or less trustworthy than digital ones? Why?” | Hard to say, I get tired of seeing all instagram ads and social media platform adds, but I am more unaware of the tv ads' impact on me. | The brands that are advertising on TV are usually bigger brands, more well-known, so they already have a base of loyal consumers/target audience. | Digital ones are having higher conversion rates for sure, because they are more targetd, and it's easier to grab attention and cause for processing actions            |   TV and digital marketing appeal to me in different ways. TV serves more as a reminder of certain topics or themes, helping build general awareness, but it often blurs specific brand identities. |
| “As a student/marketer, what did you expect about traditional media that turned out to be different?” | Is netflix ads a part of traditional media? If so, then traditional media isn't completely traditional media anymore, it has became a combination of both digital and offline? | As a student, I used to think traditional media was outdated—too broad, too hard to measure, and not relevant for today’s fast-paced marketing needs. But working in the industry, I realized traditional channels like TV or even print can be extremely powerful when used strategically. They’re not meant to drive instant clicks like digital ads. Instead, they create cultural moments, emotional resonance, and broad awareness that digital alone can’t always achieve. What surprised me most is how often traditional media becomes the ‘anchor’ for a campaign, with digital built around it. | What surprised me is that traditional media isn’t dead—it’s just different. It plays a bigger role in top-of-funnel brand building, while digital handles targeting and conversion. | Traditional ads function more as broad broadcasts—they don’t offer hyper-targeting and often deliver general information. While placing an ad on a physical medium isn’t inherently innovative, the real creativity lies in finding the right context and audience. Even in a less controllable physical space, effective placement can make a significant impact. |
|“Do you pay more attention to a TV ad, a YouTube pre-roll, or an Instagram Story ad? Why?”| instagram ads, because it's something I am prolly very interested in. | Instagram ads, attractive, appealing and very subtle | Maybe instagram? That's what I am more focus on for work  | I pay the most attention to YouTube pre-roll ads—mainly up to the point where I can skip them. They often get straight to the point and sometimes serve as helpful reminders, like during tax season. I tend to ignore Instagram Story ads completely becasuse I don't follow brands or account that is not personal friends/family. |

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |Quotes                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Traditional channels feel more trustworthy, also although they are public? But feels more private?	 | Describe what, if any changes you anticipate making to address the observation. | "They are printed and published through a credible source... And they don't follow you around like creepy ig ads" |
| Traditional ads are still present—but often subconscious  | Add the share of ad spend of traditional marketing to the story. | "I don’t remember honestly... The last TV ads I saw were probably Super Bowl ads." |
| Digital wins in targeting, but TV builds broader awareness: Professionals recognized that digital ads are better at driving conversions due to their precision, while TV ads were seen as better for general branding or emotional storytelling| look at what traditional media is often used for, I am assuming political topics? Non-profit organizations? Retail? CPG? | "Digital ones are having higher conversion rates… easier to grab attention and cause for action." |
|Lines between digital and traditional are increasingly blurry: Platforms like Netflix and YouTube are challenging what qualifies as “traditional” vs. “digital,” leading to a hybrid media ecosystem.| Find more evidence of private/public coorporations adopting "phygital" strategies for their marketing strategy | "Is Netflix a part of traditional media? If so, then traditional media isn’t completely traditional anymore." |
