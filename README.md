# Kelly-data-viz-Portfolio
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference:

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should hire me. 


# About me
Hi!  My name is Ying樱 Zhou周, but I go by Kelly. I am currently in my last semester at Carnegie Mellon University studying my master program in Data Analytics. Before coming to CMU, I have two years of experience in data-driven roles at ByteDance and Amazon, where I worked as a Customer Solutions Analyst and Project Manager. My expertise includes SQL, Python, and data visualization tools like Tableau, where I’ve helped optimize campaigns, analyze customer behavior, and improve business strategies. I'm passionate about using data to solve complex problems and drive impactful decision-making across operations and marketing.

In my spare time, I love to travel, play golf, and any water sports(free diving, scuba diving, surfing and snorkeling). 

Here is a picture of me at the Bryce Canyon Nation Park.

# What I hope to learn

1. I want to learn how to compact as much information as possible into one visualization without distracting the audience from the main message.
2. I want to understand when to use a pie chart effectively.
3. I hope to learn from my classmates' experiences with visualization, as some of them have a very artistic approach.

#  What I want to do after graduating

After graduating, I’m excited to dive into a career in data analytics and marketing, where I can use data to tackle real-world business challenges and make informed decisions. I’m looking forward to working in an innovative, collaborative environment where I can apply my skills to help teams solve problems and drive growth. I’m passionate about continuing to learn and improve in this field, and I’m eager to contribute to projects that make a tangible impact. Ultimately, I hope to use my love for marketing technology and analytics to help organizations thrive and reach their full potential.

## Assignment: [Visualizing government Debt](https://github.com/yingzho2/kelly-data-viz/blob/main/visualizing-government-debt.md)

For more information, check out the [Visualizing Government Debt](https://github.com/yingzho2/kelly-data-viz/blob/main/visualizing-government-debt.md) page.


For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](https://github.com/yingzho2/kelly-data-viz/blob/main/critique-by-design.md)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](https://github.com/yingzho2/kelly-data-viz/blob/main/final-project-part-one.md)
[Part II](https://github.com/yingzho2/kelly-data-viz/blob/main/final-project-part-two.md)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
