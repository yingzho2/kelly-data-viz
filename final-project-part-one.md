# Outline
 
I often focus on the companies where I want to work—their core values, work ethics, and job opportunities—yet rarely do I think about the people at the very top: the billionaires who own or have built these enterprises. This project stemmed from my curiosity to understand the common factors that define these individuals. The potential value in exploring this dataset is multifold. First, it offers a different perspective on career aspirations. Rather than solely focusing on company dynamics, I get to examine the traits of individuals who lead these businesses. Second, it reveals trends across industries, countries, and sources of wealth, which could inspire both entrepreneurial spirit and career direction. What makes this particularly meaningful is its real-world relevance; I can apply the insights gained to better prepare for interviews and career choices. Understanding billionaires’ backgrounds can help me recognize how different circumstances—whether through age, gender, geographic location, or industry choice—play pivotal roles in wealth accumulation. I hope to uncover trends or outliers that can demystify the "billionaire blueprint." Ultimately, this project could serve as a point of pride during job interviews, as it blends my curiosity, analytical skills, and understanding of real-world economic forces.

My interest in this project arose from a personal desire to achieve financial success and curiosity about what factors contribute to becoming a billionaire. Hearing stories of Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos often sparked my interest in wealth and entrepreneurship, but I wanted to dig deeper to uncover patterns behind their success. This dataset offered the perfect opportunity to explore whether there’s a "billionaire blueprint" based on factors like industry, demography, or geography.

The structure of my project will follow a clear storyline. I will begin with an Introduction that frames the topic: we often focus on companies rather than the individuals behind them. I will introduce the central question: Is there a "billionaire blueprint"? Next, in the Methodology section, I will present the dataset and highlight the key variables I plan to analyze, including industry, country, age, gender, and source of wealth. I will describe my approach to exploring the data and identifying patterns.

Following this, the Key Findings section will summarize major trends observed, such as the most common industries among billionaires, typical ages at which they accumulated wealth, geographic concentrations, and the distribution by gender. I will also highlight interesting outliers or surprising results that do not fit the general patterns. In the Insights and Implications section, I will interpret what these findings suggest about building wealth and connect these insights to practical career planning, entrepreneurial strategies, and personal development. Finally, I will conclude with a Conclusion that reflects on the overall story and what it teaches about success pathways, emphasizing how understanding billionaires' backgrounds can offer valuable real-world lessons.

The story arc for this project will follow a clear progression. The problem is that people often overlook the individuals behind major companies. The rising action involves analyzing billionaires’ backgrounds to uncover trends across demographics, industries, and geographies. The climax will be revealing the key findings, showing whether clear patterns exist. The resolution will apply the lessons learned to personal career choices and broader reflections on success.

The project is designed with the following user stories in mind. As a job seeker, I want to understand what industries and traits are common among billionaires so I can better plan my career path. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I want to learn what geographic regions and sources of wealth are most common to guide my startup goals. As a student, I want to see real-world examples of success to better prepare for the future.

# The data


| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
|  Forbes Billionaires Evolution (1997-2024)    |  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/forbes-billionaires-1997-2023   |      The "Forbes Billionaires Evolution" dataset provides a comprehensive examination of the financial growth and status of global billionaires from 1997 to 2024. It meticulously chronicles the transformations, both subtle and substantial, in the fortunes of these financial titans over nearly three decades.       |

# Method and medium
To complete my final project, I plan to primarily use Tableau for data visualization and analysis. Tableau will help me create interactive charts and dashboards that reveal trends in the billionaire dataset. I also plan to use Shorthand, a storytelling platform, to organize my findings into a clear, engaging narrative. Shorthand will allow me to structure the project visually, combining text, graphics, and visualizations in a seamless flow. I may incorporate images from online resources to enhance the storytelling and make the project more visually appealing.
