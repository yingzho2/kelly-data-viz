# Part 3

For Part 3, I began with the following questions:

The original chart is very large — how can I condense the information into a more compact format (ideally without requiring the viewer to scroll)?

How can I make the chart more of a summary that better tells a story?

How can I highlight the overall debt-to-GDP trend over time, without focusing too much on individual countries?

With these three questions in mind, I chose to use a box-and-whisker plot to display the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum, and extreme outliers. This approach effectively visualizes the data’s central tendency, spread, and potential outliers.

Instead of listing out every country name like in the original chart, I set the Rows as "Value" and renamed the axis to “Debt to GDP Ratio” to provide a clearer understanding of what the values represent.

Similar to the original visualization, I used "Year" in the Columns to maintain a timeline and show the trend we want to observe.

For "Location," I chose not to use color to distinguish countries because my focus was not on individual country performance, but rather on highlighting notable patterns. (In the next step, I chose to highlight Japan, as it shows a persistent trend of increasing debt-to-GDP ratio.)

Overall, the graph gave me a much clearer visual of the Global Debt-to-GDP Ratio Trends (1995–2019), which I used as the title.

When viewing the graph, I immediately noticed a persistent outlier. Since Tableau is interactive, I hovered over that dot and found that the country was Japan. Beginning in 1999, Japan showed a continuous upward trend in its debt-to-GDP ratio. It rose steadily, slowed down after 2004, and then jumped by about 11% between 2008 and 2009. From 2014 to 2017, there was a slight decline, but the ratio rose again in 2018.

I believe this graph is meant to invite exploration — to help the audience identify interesting trends in the data. In my opinion, it is more effective than the heatmap because it presents a high-level overview instead of listing each country's individual values. While the original chart focused on "listing out the facts," mine provides more space for observation and for identifying anomalies — which is often the first step data analysts take when diving deeper into insights.
